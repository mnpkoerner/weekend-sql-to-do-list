# Project Name

Weekend Project: To Do List

## Description

Weekend assignment from Prime Academy full-stack engineering This is my first full-stack application! The goal of the project was to build a full-stack to do list. Full CRUD! They challenged us to build a dynamic UI, comprehensive client-side logic, and a database for permanent data storage. My iteration will display two different tables: uncompleted and completed tasks. You're able to sort the tables in a few different ways, delete information from the database, and mark when tasks are complete. You're also able to compare the ammount of time you estimate an activity to take with the actual time the activity took, hopefully teaching you how best to estimate your time and manage your day!
